Average life expectancy at birth was \~40 years for those born between 1906–1912, \~50 years for those born between 1933–1936 and \~55 years for those born between 1946–1947.

Between 1880 and 1940 \~570 000 Turks and \~60 000 Greeks left Bulgaria. Approximately 125 000 Bulgarians emigrated for economic reasons overseas. Unsuccessful wars left 2 000 000 Bulgarians out of the country borders. Some 500 000 immigrated to Bulgaria.

*1879 Apr 16*: The Bulgarian constitution was adopted. Bulgaria became a constitutional monarchy with unicameral parliament and universal voting rights for citizens above the age of 21. On the next day Alexander Batenberg, who was a nephew of the Russian empress, was selected as the Prince of Bulgaria. The Prince had the right to confirm laws passed by parliament. He also had executive powers.

*1881 Apr 27*: Prince Alexander Batenberg suspended the constitution. The bone of contention was the extent of the monarch’s power in the constitution. He was opposed by the Liberal party, who wanted larger role of the parliament. The Prince had the support of the Conservative party and internationally by Russia, as well as Germany, Austria-Hungary and Great Britain. After that Batenberg was ruling by decrees and there was no prime minister.

*1883 Sep*: The constitution was restored. There were internal tensions between the supporters of Batenberg that were related to the building of a new railroad. On one hand were the Conservative party, on the other there was the Russian lobby. To resist Russian interests, the Prince and the Conservatives sought support from the Liberals. Batenberg promised to restore the constitution if Liberals supported some changes that limited voting rights and introduced a bicameral parliament. As a result the Liberal party split into two - around Dragan Tsankov, who supported the compromise, and around Petko Karavelov, who didn’t. Karavelov’s party won the elections and reinstalled the original constitution in 1886.

*1885 Sep*: Unification of Eastern Rumelia and the Principality of Bulgaria. Russia disapproved the Unification (even though Russia signed the Tophane Agreement on 24 March 1886 together with the other great European powers, which lead to the official recognition of the Unification) .

*1885*: Serbo-Bulgarian war.

*1886 Aug*: Coup against Alexander Batenberg by pro-Russian military officers. The prince was dethroned and expelled from Bulgaria, but the chairman of the National assembly - Stefan Stambolov - organized counter-coup and managed to restore Batenberg to power. However shortly after he returned to Bulgaria, Batenberged decided to step-off after failing to restore good relations with Russia. A regency was set up, headed by Stefan Stambolov.

*1886 Nov 6*: Russia broke diplomatic relations with Bulgaria.

*1887 Feb*: Pro-Russian army officers attempted a coup against the regency council. They had the support of the armed forces in Ruse and Silistra but ultimately were unsuccessful.

*1887 Aug*: Ferdinand von Sachsen-Coburg-Gotha became the new Bulgarian monarch. However he didn’t have the support of the Great Powers, which was against the provisions of the Treaty of Berlin.

*1890*: An unsuccessful plot by the army officer Kosta Panitza to dethrone Ferdinand as king and remove Stambolov as a prime minister. He wanted a military engagement in Macedonia. He was supported by Russia for the plot.

*1891*: Attempted assassination against Stambolov. It was in response to the death sentence of Kosta Panitza. Stambolov used the assassination attempt as an excuse to go after some of the leaders of the opposition. For example, Petko Karavelov was sentenced to 3 years in prison.

> *note*: In its internal policies the Stambolov lead government was very authoritarian in character. Most of the opposition newspapers were abolished and elections were rigged. Even though the army was mostly cleared of pro-Russian supporters, Stambolov won many enemies.

*1894 May*: Stambolov resigned. Ferdinand I accepted his resignation. Stambolov had been involved in a scandal related to a love affair with the wife of an army officer, who was also a relative of the Minister of Defence.

*1895 Jul*: Stambolov was killed in an assasination.

*1895 Jul*: A delegation sent by Ferdinand is accepted by the new Russian Emperor Nikolay II.

*1896 Feb*: Ferdinand’s son, Boris, was baptized as an Eastern Orthodox. Following that act Russia recognized Ferdinand as a legitimate Bulgarian monarch. The other Great Powers followed suit.

*1900*: Riots against the introduction of a new tax on agricultural produce by the liberal government of Todor Ivanchov. It included mostly rural areas in North-Eastern Bulgaria. In February 1900 more than 10000 protested in Ruse and in March - 15000 in Varna. In the village of Krasen protests in March 1900 lead to clashes between protesters and the police. The conflict escalated to arm clashes, both the police and the peasants receiving reinforcements. In April the peasants from Trastenik expelled the mayor and overpowered the police sent to restore him. The police got reinforcements from the army, but only when reinforcements came from Tarnovo, the riot was put under control. More than 270 people were arrested. In May and June there were armed clashes between the military and the peasants. Approximately 90 people were killed and more than 100 were arrested. During the summer in North-Eastern Bulgaria there was a state of marshal law. The new government of Petko Karavelov lifted the tax and announced amnesty for the peasants who had rioted.

*1903–1912*: Several prime ministers were accused by a State court following parliamentary commissions for mishandling state finances for personal benefit. The names included Vasil Radoslavov, Todor Ivanchov, Petar Gudev, Racho Petrov and Dimitar Petkov. However there were no effective punishments, either because the convicted received an amnesty or because the court disbanded by the parliament.

*1907 Mar*: Prime minister Dimitar Petkov was killed by a former bank clerk.

*1908*: Proclamation of the Bulgarian independence, which had retained some formal dependence to the Ottoman empire.

*1918*: Ferdinand I stepped off the throne in favour of his son Boris III.

*1923 Jun 9*: Successful coup organized by the Military Union and backed by king Boris III against the government of Aleksandar Stambolijski and his Bulgarian Agrarian National Union. Stambolijski himself was killed.

*1923*: Uprisings by supporters of Stambolijski in June.

*1923 Sep*: Uprisings by supporters of the Communist party. The number of people killed varies between 1000 and 5000 according to different estimates.

*1925 Apr 16*: In an assassination attempt on king Boris III and high ranking government officials and military officers the communists killed with a bomb 134 people in the church “Sveta Nedelya”. Approximately 500 were injured. Later that day the government declared a state of marshal law which remained in force until October. Approximately 500 people died as a result of the government measures after that.

*1934* May 19: The Zveno organization and the Military Union organization overthrew the government of the Popular Bloc coalition. Political parties were banned and the constitution was suspended. The new prime minister became Kimon Georgiev from Zveno. However an year later the King managed to remove Georgiev and to replace him with Andrey Toshev, who was loyal to him. After that some of the officers from the Military Union try to plot against Boris III and remove him from power, while others declare their loyalty to him. The Zveno organization moves into opposition of the monarchy.

### The Bulgarian economy in the Third Bulgarian Kingdom

#### Agriculture and industry

|Per Capita GDP, 1990 \$|1890|1910|1929|1937|
|:----------------------|:---|:---|:---|:---|

> *note*: Three strands to the debate about growth since the end of the 19th century: *convergence* to the economic core, although moderate; *divergence* - falls in productivity and digression from a market to a subsistence agricultural economy (revisionist view); *middle ground*. A reason for differences in the opinions is the lack of consistent quantitative evidence to establish the growth rates.
>
> *note*: Industrial **share of national output** was \~ 15% almost for the whole period. The agricultural share - between 70% and 80%.
>
> *note*: Break with the Ottoman Empire resulted in restrited domestic **markets**, redistribution of land into small landholdings. Retreat from market relations to subsistence farming in the sector is a widely held view by Bulgarian historians.
>
> *note*: Initially many small agricultural producers went bankrupt due to high interest rates and low prices of the final produce. Things improved by the beginning of the XX century, as interest rates fell and food prices increased. On average **agricultural production** grew by 3% till 1911. It was the result mostly of using new land and to a smaller extent of increased productivity. The average grain yield was \~ 100 kg / decare. Cooperatives were popular among small producers. After the wars agriculture still employed most of the population \~ 3/4. Total land used increased by 10% in the late 1920s relative to 1911. Average yield increased by 20–45% for cereals, 45–60% for orchards. The volume of agricultural produce was below the prewar level until 1925, but by the end of the 1930s it was 70% higher (with increased population of 43%). While grain still had the largest share, the shares of tobacco, cotton, sugar beet increased. The mechanization of the sector was low, even though the situation was improving - by 1944 there were 4500 tractors. There were \~ 3500 agriculture cooperatives that involved around 1 000 000 people.
>
> *note*: Sectors with some growth outside agriculture were usually **state protected industries** - mining, metal works, electricity production, chemical products. State supported enterprises in 1909–1939 increased 4 times, employees - 3 times.
>
> *note*: By 1897 there were only 70 industrial enterprises with more than 10 employees. In 1911 there number reached 345 and employed in total 15000 workers. In 1896 the **local industry** (without crafts and services) supplied 13% of the internal consumption of industrial goods, whereas in 1911 - 43%. This was the result of improved transport infrastructure, increased tariffs (14–65%), other forms of legal protection, lower interest rates with the development of a modern banking system. However the volume of industrial production per capita was 20–45 times lower compared to industrialized countries. After the wars the Bulgarian industry underwent a crisis, but the depreciation of the lev that went on until 1923 stimulated investment. The volume of industrial produce grew by 7.7% on average per year in the period 1921–1931. Industrial production was relatively inefficient and by the outbreak of the WW II the sources of growth were to a large extent exhausted. Labour **productivity** in the industrial sectors was 2 times lower in 1911 and 4 times lower in 1939 relative to that of the United States.
>
> *note*: Finance, industry and political interests were often mixed and this led to inefficiencies and **corruption**. As an example railroad construction was twice as expensive per km in Bulgaria than in Greece and Romania. Example: Racho Petrov, who was prime minister in the beginnig of XX c., had also stakes in the company that built the railroad line Radomir-Kyustendil. Many of these were companies that were somehow related to the bank “Girdap”.
>
> *note*: The volume of **external trade** doubled in 1906–1911 relative to 1886–1890. Measured per capita, it was still 2–7 times lower than the developed countries. The main export good was grain. The trade balance was negative. The balance of payments was adjusted by foreign loans. After the wars the trade volume fell, as it did during the crisis of 1929–1933. However by the end of the period it was three times higher than the prewar level (at constant prices). Bulgaria exported mostly tobacco, fruits, vegetables, eggs and chickens. The imports changed as the share of investment goods rose. In the 1930s Bulgaria traded mostly with Germany using clearing agreements where it had a favourable balance.
>
> *note*: Before the Balkan wars the average **wage** was between 34 and 70 levs, whereas the prices of bread were 0.23 - 0.30 per kg and for meat 0.46–0.98 per kg. The workday was more than 10 hours. In 1919 was introduced an 8-hour work day by law, but usually it was ignored. In 1939 the real wages for the Bulgarian workers were 2–4 lower than those in the deveoped countries.


#### Money, banking and finance

*1879*: establishment of the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB). However it was more a commercial bank than a central bank.

*1880*: the Bulgarian lev was adopted as a national currency. Initially issuing rights belonged to the state, not to BNB.

*1881*: first stock company in Bulgaria - savings association “Girdap” was established in Ruse with initial capital of only 750 lv. Between 1912 and 1918 it had control over capital of 83,97 million levs. Existed until 1925. Since 1911 its director had been Boncho Bonev, a former chairman of BNB.

*1885 - by*: the BNB had full issuing rights and was involved in the provision of credit to customers. This should have ended by 1928, but it retained 10% of the direct credit for some time after that.

*1891*: first insurance stock company in Bulgaria established in Ruse.

*1903*: reform in commercial legislation, which allowed foregin residents to sit in the controlling committees of joint stock companies.

*1907*: the Law on manufacturing credit. A step towards establishing BNB as “the bank of banks”.

*1910 - by*: the BNB, Bulgarska Zemedelska Banka (BZB), Bulgarska Tsentralna Kooperativna Banka (BCCB) were created by the state. They operated mostly through intermediaries - BZB through agricultural credit cooperatives and BCCB - through the so called popular banks.

*1911–1928*: doubling in the value of loans given out by private commercial institutions

*1924*: new law on BNB. New emissions of money could be no longer backed by silver - only by gold.

*1926*: new law on BNB. Specified explicitly the monopoly right of banknote emmissions and gave it responsibility to maintain the stability of the lev and to regulate the money supply in addition to facilitating payments in the economy. The law forbade BNB from extending credits to the state, as well as credits without colateral.

*1928*: new law on BNB. The bank had to stop commercial operations. It became a modern central bank.

*1926*: the Refugee Settlement Loan (foreign). Contracted with West European commercial banks with the help of the League of Nations. It was used to provide land and houses to accomodate the refugees after the wars. Some of the money went to infrastructure development. Lyapchev's government staked as collateral a part of the tax revenues. As a condition for the loan the League of nation got some control over the financial policy of the country.

*1928*: the Stabilisation Loan (foreign). Its goal was to capitalize BNB and to provide convertibility to the lev. 

*1929 - by*: a total of 13 large foreign banks accounted for some 40% of the private bank capital in Bulgaria.

*1930*: more than 150 banks in existence. By 1937 their number dropped to 80.

*1929–1932*: deposits in private banks declined by \~50%, following a 100% increase in the 1920s.

*1931–1934*: foregin banking capital fell from 20% of total active capital to less than 7%.

*1932 - by*: three laws were passed to protect banks from liquidity problems.

> *note*: insider lending: shareholders, directors of officers of the bank or their familiy or their firms increased the problems, caused by the depression.

*1935*: creation of Banka Bulgarski Kredit (BCB) to gather the remnants of small banks after the bankrupcies into one large institution. While formally it was private, it was in practice controlled by the state.

*1936 - by*: the two largest private institutions had more deposits than the four foreign banks still present in the Bulgarian credit market after the Depression and also twice as much as all the small private banks together.

*1943*: new law on BNB which allowed the state to intervene in its operations.

#### Transport and utilities

> *note*: By 1900 the total railroad length was 1175 km, by 1911 - 1945 km, by 1921 - 2290 km, by 1939 - 3050 km. Trains initially functioned bellow capacity and usually were not economically profitable (between 1888 and 1937 BDZ made a profit only in 8 years). The density of the railroad network was lower than in Romania and Greece. Traffick fares were the lowest in Europe, but speeds were also very low (\~30 km/h). Train traffic had been increasing until 1929 when it began to fall following competition from automobile transport.

Table: Roads in Bulgaria

|year|state roads|municipality roads|
|:---|:----------|:-----------------|
|1887|3367 km|359 km|
|1912|6422 km|2454 km|
|1918|6100 km|4050 km|
|1939|19 553 km||

> *note*: **Roads** were usually in poor condition. Road building was boosted by the obligatory labour service after WW I.
>
> *note*: The number of **motor vehicles** increased from 3402 in 1935 to 10 013 in 1939. Bulgaria had two times less automobiles per capita compared to Romania and Yugoslavia.
>
> *note*: Foreign trade shifted routes from the Danube to the Black Sea. Port Burgas was opened in 1903 and port Varna was open for exploitation in 1906. The river **ports** in Ruse and Svishtov were rebuilt and opened in 1912 and 1913.
>
> *note*: **Telegraf** service started (in the Principality of Bulgaria) with the inherited from the Russian army 26 telegraf stations and 1630 km line. In 1900 the telegraf-and-postal stations were 225, in 1919 - 420, in 1931 - 575, in 1939 - 806. The number of letters and **postal packages** sent increased from 17,8 million in 1900 to 72,5 million in 1912 to 192 million in 1932. Bulgaria compared well with other Balkan countries but lagged behind developed countries significantly (17 packages per person for 1925, compared with more than 100 for Western European countries). Many people complained about the quality of the service in principle and about intrusion in the privacy of the correspondence in particular. Working conditions in the services were usually poor and capital investments were low.
>
> *note*: The first intercity **phone** line was set up between Sofia and Plovdiv in 1892, followed by the line between Sofia and Ruse in 1895. Until 1893 phones were used only by state representatives. In 1893 opened a public phone station, and their number increased to 34 till 1911. In 1938 120 towns and villages had public phone stations. In the 1930s Bulgaria had phone connection with 25 European countries and with North America. In 1924 phone talks per capita in Bulgaria were 3.5, compared to 4 for Romania and more than 20 for Germany, UK, and Belgium.

|year|phones|phone lines|
|:---|:-----|:----------|
|1886|5|19,5 km|
|1900|457|883,0 km|
|1912|2972|2 439,0 km|
|1930|17 373|13 445,0 km|
|1939|29 088|21 255,0 km|

*1927*: Civilian **airtravel** started as Sofia became a mid-station in the airline Paris-Istanbul.

*1930*: **Radio** emissions were broadcasted on a regular basis.

|year|radio sets|
|:---|:-----|
|1930|1 341|
|1934|7 899|
|1938|40 260|
|1940|90 025|
|1943|174 465|

In 1938 Bulgaria had 7 radio sets per 1000 people, while Italy had 23, Austria - 92, France - 112 and Germany - 133.

#### Health, social insurance and social policy

> *note*: After the Liberation there were 5 hospitals. In a couple of years 13 more were added. Initially health issues were under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of internal affairs. In 1878 there were 71 doctors, in 1903 - 559, in 1909 - 632.

*1882*: Public-administrative regulation for the obligations of entrepreneurs of public works. It specified obligations for the creation of a fund in case of work-related accidents, illness and death. Installments had to be 2% of the total value of construction works.

*1886*: Law on the pensions for disabled soldiers.

*1887*: Law on scholarships and temporary aid. Schoalrship holders are obliged to work for the state, if invited, for the same period for which they received financial help.

*1888*: Law on the pensions of teachers.

*1888*: New health-related laws. They followed the French legislation. A three-tier system of hospitals (7 first-tier hospitals in the biggest towns). The system was very centralized. The laws regulated also the provision of dental services.

*1889*: Law on pensions and aid for priests.

*1880s and 1890s*: Various institutes were established to protect from epidemies.

*1903*: New law on public health. Health provision became more decentralized. Obligatory vaccinаtion for measles.

> *note*: In 1903 80% of the population lived in settlements without a doctor. In 1905 state budget expenses for health amounted only to 0,69 levs per person. In 1912 there were 670 doctors (15 per 100 000), of them 193 were practicing privately (while the number of doctors subsequently grew, usually less than half were practicing privately for the whole period); 170 dentists (almost all at private practice); 63 state, 3 municipality and 5 private hospitals. Hospitals were short of doctors, equipment, and medication.

| year | state hospitals | private hospitals | s.h. beds | p.h. beds | doctors | dentists |
|-----:|----------------:|------------------:|----------:|----------:|--------:|---------:|
| 1912 |              63 |                 5 |           |           |     670 |      170 |
| 1923 |              83 |                 6 |           |           |    1011 |      208 |
| 1934 |              63 |                74 |      6893 |      1432 |    2607 |      786 |
| 1939 |              61 |                94 |      7462 |      2270 |    3127 |     1206 |

*1905*: Law unifying all existing insurance funds under the control of the so-called Department of Labour.

*1918*: Obligatory insurance for all workers and servants in state and municipality enterprises. 1% installments by each party - worker, employer, state.

*1924*: Law on public insurence. 2/3 of the *Fund for public insurance* was filled by employers and the state, 1/3 - by the employees.

> *note*: Choice of doctors was entirely free, but usually only young doctors wanted to work with the fund.

*1929*: Law on public insurances. Introduced a regulated free choice of the doctor. Doctors were paid, medicine expenses were covered only for medicines from a predetermined list. In 2 years time the costs to run the system exceeded the revenues by 2,5 times.

*1929*: Law on people’s health. Medical services could be offered only at specialized places, not at homes. A lot of services at working organizations were created as a result.

*1934*: Doctors were no longer freely chosen. Those that worked with the fund were appointed. The deficit in the system however continued to increase. In 1939 there was a return to the free choice of a doctor.

> *note*: According to a comment from 1936 less than half of the insured actually made any payments. The state was especially umreliable in this respect. It even borrowed money from the fund for other purposes.
>

*1940*: General (and obligatory) immunization against typhus. Before that (since 1924) it included only risky areas and was voluntary.

> *note*: Tuberculosis was the most dangerous disease during the period. It 1934 17,7 per 10 000 people died of tuberculosis, 16,3 in 10 000 of heart disease, 15,2 in 10 000 of pneumonia.

*1941*: Institute for public insurance. A semi-autonomous organization, governed by representatives of the insured, employers, and the Ministry of trade, industry and labour.

*1943*: All state servants and their families could benefit from free medical services in state hospitals. In private hospitals their expenses were covered at 50%.

> *note*: People with health insurance increased from 34 000 in 1919, through 130 000 in 1925, to 250 000 in 1939.

> *note*: People using free health services (poor people and some state servants) increased from 15 000 in 1903 to 1 180 000 in 1941 (expanded to include pregnant women and children bellow school age).

> *note*: The social insurance system was beset by problems due to frequent changes in its arrangement, lack of experience managing it and inefficient investment decisions.

### Public infrastructure

> *note*: Sanitation was poor, especially in the beginning of the period. In 1921 only in 11 towns there was a modern water-carrying system. Elsewhere it was made of clay tubes, if there was one at all. By the end of 1939 57 out of 97 towns were fully supplied with water, 15 - partially. Out of 4289 villages only 380 were fully and 596 were partially supplied with modern water-carrying systems. By the end of the period only 10 towns had canalization and it was usually incomplete.

> *note*: By the end of 1935 there was electricity in 238 settlements with a total population of 1 612 155 people, by 1937 - 331 settlements with a population of 1 867 287 people. However not all buildings in these settlements were electrified.

### Education

*1889*: Higher pedagogical course. Poor students could study for free.

*1889*: Law on the establishment of a higher school.

### Law and order

*1889*: Law on the police. Police was under the control of the respective civil authorities. Police officers had the right to 1 month vacation and retirement after 20 years of service with 2/3 of their salary.

*1889*: Law on inheritance.

*1889*: Law on military service. Obligatory military service - 1 year for people with high-school education.


People’s Republic of Bulgaria
=============================

Periodization - based on the dynamics of the differenet parts of the system and how they hang together. Basic elements, determining the mutation of the regime:

-   changes in the social structure of society

-   changes in the level of education

-   introduction of new technologies

-   changes in the publlic-private sphere relationships

-   geopolitical changes

Periods:

-   First period 1944–1956: coming to power and taking control over society.

-   Second period 1956–1986: destalinization and normalization of everyday life in the context of the absence of individual rights and freedoms.

-   Third period 1987–1989: final crisis of the regime.

>
> *note*: Initially some repressive laws were abolished.
>
> *note*: It didn't take long however before the start of mass arrests of people against whom no charges were pressed.

*1945 - Sep*: The newly formed opposition in the face of the Agrarian Union (of Nikola Petkov), the Social-Democratic party and the Democratic party was allowed to partiicpate in the forthcoming elections.

*1945 - 18 Nov*: The elections were unilaterally won by the communists, as the opposition refused to participate in a situation they considered as not normal.

> *note*: The new National Assembley adopted 250 laws in 9 months.

*1945 - Dec*: Under pressure from USA and UK the government agreed to include members of the opposition. However the positions offered were minor and they refused.

*1948*: The number of detained in the Belene camp alone at the time was 4 500. Approximately 30 000 had been resettled.

> *note*: At this time repression started to turn internally on members of the party. The hunt for the “enemy with party ticket” began. This was the result of the break between Stalin and Tito (accused of being a nationalist who didn’t follow the principles of communist internationalism).

*1949 - Feb*: The Fatherland Front was transformed in a mass organization and lost its significance.

*1948 - 5 Dec*: Stalin accused Traytcho Kostov (second in rank after Dimitrov in BCP) in nationalism (he refused to share information with Soviet specialists about Bulgarian foreign trade).

*1949*: Unit VII of the Directorate “State Security” was created (the so-called “Sledstven otdel”), which was responsible for much of the out-of-court violence.

*1949*: The state tried to legislate and regulate the activity of the prison camps (even though they had existed since 1945). In a decision of Politbureau, taken on 1 Aug 1950, this unit was said to have committed perversions.

*1950*: Valko Chervenkov became the new leader of the party. Attempt to establish personality cult.

*1950–1953*: Peak in the “goryani” movement. According to official data they amounted to 7 000 people. However both they and the authorities tried to avoid direct armed conflict. After the end of the Korean war and the Hungarian events of 1956 the movement lost momentum.

*1952*: The activity of Unit VII of the Directorate “State Security” became regulated with instructions how to conduct investigation and interrogation. This marked an attempt to move from direct physical coercion to other forms of gathering information. The so-called “agents” became the preferred method.

*1952–1956*: Glavlit was created. It was an openly censoring institution, whose goal was to monitor public information in the periodicals, on radio and in theaters.

*1953 8 May*: Mitropolit Kiril of Plovdiv was elected for Bulgarian Patriarch. The Constantinople Patriarchate didn’t accept the election, because it had not been preliminary agreed with it. The Bulgarian Patrirach was officialy recognized in 1961.

*1953*: Valko Chervenkov made a speech, criticizing the existence of prison camps.

*1953 5 Sep*: The Belene camp was closed after a decision of Politbureau.

*1954 - 26 Jan*: The position “general secretary of the CC of BCP” was no longer to exist, following the advice of the new Soviet leader - Hruschev. Instead it was split in two positions - “prime minister” and “first secretary of the CC of BCP”. Chervenkov became the prime-minister, first secretary - Todor Zhivkov.

*1954 - 17 Apr*: Valko Chervenkov criticized in a speech “State Security” for trying to put itself above the party and the government.

*1954 - autumn*: Some incarcerated communists were released after receiving a pardon.

*1956 - Feb*: In Moscow at the XX congress of the Communist party of the Soviet Union Hruschev made a speech sharply criticizing the personality cult and launching a course for destalinization. In private Hruschev accused Chervenkov of not doing destalinization quickly enough.

*1956 - Apr*: At a plenary session of the CC of BCP Zhivkov attacked Chervenkov for “personality cult”. Chervenkov stepped down as a prime minister.

> *note*: Initially party members at places misperceived this call for destalinization as desire for deeper changes. As a result an article in “Rabotnichesko delo” had to set the straight line.

*1956 - autumn*: The Belene camp was reopened, following the events in Hungary.

*1958–1959*: Sporadic initiatives to ban Muslim clothing in some parts of the country.

*1959 - Dec*: The Ministry of health and social services issued a note outlawing circumcision performed not by doctors and outside hospitals.

*1959 - 27 Aug*: The Belene camp and some other prison camps were officially closed after a decision of Politbureau. At the time in the camp there were 276 people.

*1959*: The committee of the active fighters against fascism was created. A system of privilleges was established for the “active fighters”. In this way Zhivkov won additional support within the party.

*1959*: Administrative reform that allowed Zhivkov to install his own loyal people at many of the new positions.

*1961–1968*: The Rila monastery was turned into a museum.

*1962 - 5 Apr*: Politbureu took a decision to limit some expressions of turkification of Bulgarian muslims, Gipsys and Tatars. Local authorities were allowed to change names in a simplified administrative procedure without a court decision.

*1962*: The Lovetch camp was closed after a decision by Politbureau.

*1962 - 4 Nov*: At a plenary session of the CC of BCP were discussed the gross perversions of State Security in the period 1949–1956. This was an attack against Anton Yugov, who was at the time internal opposition to Zhivkov and had been involved in State Security before that.

*1962 - 20 Nov*: Zhivkov became Prime-Minister.

> *note*: Zhivkov managed to replace relatively quickly the party elite with loyal to him party members. He usually avoided physical elimination of his opponents, instead reappointing them to other positions.

*1961*: The Communist Party of the Soviet Union specified in its new program the goal of “ever closer cohesion of the national economies” and in perspective - a new communist economy, regulated by a single plan. In July 1962 Zhivkov hinted for an organic merge of the economies of Bulgaria and USSR within Comecon. However at the July 1963 session of Comecon USSR met the opposition of China and Romania. Allegedly, Zhivkov inquired what were the chances of a political and economic union between Bulgaria and USSR, before leaving the Comecon session in Moscow. At the July plenum of the Bulgarian Communist Party the party discussed the cohesion and in perspective the union with USSR. In August 1963 Zhivkov submitted to Politbureau a draft letter to Hruschov regarding the form of the union - a confederation or a federation. Politbureau was not enthusiastic, however at a plenum of the Central Committee in December 1963 it received support. At a meeting in February 1964 Hruschev and Zhivkov decided that the best form of the union would be a confederation.

*1964*: Attempts to change the names of Bulgarian muslims in Ribnovo resulted in riots.

*1964*: Hruschev fell from power in USSR, which lead to the activization of the internal opposition to Zhivkov, mostly from neostalinist and maoist groups.

*1965*: Some neostalinist party members tred to organize a coup against Zhivkov. They were arrested and sentenced to 15 years imprisonment.

*1967*: Unit 6 of State Security was established. The goal of the unit was to combat expressions of ideological diversion.

*1970 - 17 Jul*: The secretariat of the CC of BCP took the decision to continue the work on improving the social status of Bulgarian muslims and to launch a campaign to change their names.

*1971–1973*: New campaign for the changing of names in the Rhodophi mountains. Most resistence in the Western Rhodophi, where 5 people were killed. Many were resettled.

*1971 - 7 Mar*: Patriarch Kiril died. Maksim was elected as the new patriarch.

*1971*: New constitution adopted at a referendum (99,66% for). The infamous Article 1 for the leading role of the Bulgarian Comunist Party in society. The principle of unity of state power - formally the separation of powers was elminated. The State Council was created. Its powers were higher than those of the National Assembley. Private property was not mentioned (there was “personal property”).

*1972*: Another internal plot against Zhivkov was prevented.

*1973* - Jul: At a plenum of the CC of BCP were adopted “Main guidelines for the development of the cooperation with USSR”. Brezhnev came to Sofia in September 1973. In exchange for Bulgaria’s loyalty Bulgaria received between 1979 and 1985 gratuitous help of 2.9 billion rubles. These were agreed upon in May 1979 and included price additions for Bulgarian agricultural and light industry imports to USSR, as well as mineral resources at preferential prices that were \~ 50% lower than the world prices. However Bulgaria had to buy machinery and weapons from USSR and to finance the establishment of extraction industry equipment in the USSR amounting to more than 2 billion rubles (in exchange of future use of the resources).

*1974 - Feb*: At a plenary session of CC of BCP for the first time officially was discussed the change of names also of the Turkish ethnic group.

*1974 - 20 Aug*: Decree on the rights and functions of State Security. It’s goal was defined as providing security of the People’s Republic of Bulgaria and defending the socialist institutions. State Security was allowed to use citizens “for voluntary cooperation”. Alegedly the number of paid collaborators was between 15 000 and 20 000, while informers were 50 000 - 65 000.

*1975 - 1 Aug*: Bulgaria signed the Helsinki accords - the final act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, held in Finland. These included texts on honouring human rights and fundamental freedoms, such as freedom of thought and speech and the right of peoples to self-determination.

*1982–1984*: The names of \~ 50 000 were changed.

*1984 - 30 Aug*: Two bombs exploded on the railway station in Plovidv and at a parking in Varna near the airport. One was killed and 44 were injured. Bombs were set up by ethnic Turks.

*1984 - Dec*: A massive campaign on the change of names was launched. Until February 1985 administratively were changed the names of 800 000 people. This was accompanied by unrest, which was contained using physical violence. Approximately 50 people were killed. Speaking Turkish in public was forbidden.

*1985 - 9 Mar*: A bomb killed 7 people on the Bunovo railway station. It was set up by a pro-Turkish illegal organization.

*1987*: Demonstrations in Ruse against the air polution.

*1988 - Jan*: The “Independent union for the protection of human rights in Bulgaria” was created. No communist party member was part of it.

*1988 - 8 Mar*: “Public committee for ecological protection of Ruse” was created.

*1988 - 3 Nov*: “The club for support of glasnost and perestrojka in Bulgaria” was created. Its chairman was Zhelyo Zhelev.

*1989 - 29 May*: Zhivkov made a TV appearance announcing that if Turkey opened its border, the Bulgarian state will not prevent those who desire to leave. Turkey opened its borders on 3 June and closed them on 21 August. 360 000 left, however by 1990 150 000 returned to Bulgaria.

Agriculture in Socialist Bulgaria
---------------------------------

### A Snapshot After WWII

> 76% of the population lived in villages and 68% were employed in agriculture. - there were 1 million farms encompassing 13 million fields. - 712 000 farms had less than 50 decares, only 200 farmes had more than 500 decares. - agriculutral cooperatives had already existed before the end of the war, though voluntary and based on private property.

### The Collectivization of Land

#### The pre-mass collectivization stage

*1945 Apr*: Law on the Labour-Cooperative Agrarian Farms (LCAFs).

*1946 Mar*: According to a new law, the largest farm properties couldn’t exceed 200 decares (300 decares if in Dobrudzha). Everything above this limit, along with church, vakaf, municipality and school land was expropriated. This land was distributed between landless peasants, but they had to pay it, unless they joined a LCAF. They could keep only between 5 and 10 decares for personal needs. However the available land for redistribution was only 1/4 of the needed for the reform.

*1947 autumn*: The system of takings was introduced. All that was produced was taken by the state with the exception of 600 g of grain and 200 g of corn per family member per day.

> *note*: Crop was obligatory harvested and piled in a common pool to avoid cheating the state. The produce taken was actually paid for but at 1/4 and 1/3 of the market value. By 1948 the system was expanded to include other crops and animal products. This system was applied only to owners, who hadn’t joined a LCAF.
>
> *note*: What was not taken by the state by the system of takings could be sold freely (in theory). However the state had determined price ceilings for this excessive produce.
>
> *note*: Another instrument to induce membership in LCAFs were the buy-off plans. The buy-off plans were determined by the state. Private owners had to make available specific quantities of crop for state buy-off. Failing to do so could lead to their land being confiscated.
>
> *note*: Still another instrument (introduced in 1946) was progressive taxation. An owner who had less than 30 decares, no more than one cow and five sheep paid no personal income tax.

*1947*: Law for decreasing the number of pubs and for limiting booze. Declared that there could be no more than one pub per 700 people. It also lead to abolishing the private trade with alcohol.

*1948 - by*: LCAFs amountd to 400, only 8% of farm owners were part of it.

#### The mass collectivization stage

*1948 Feb - Mar*: The Law on LCAFs was updated. Some other laws were passed, too. As a result agricultural machinery was nationalized for all owners of farms above 50 decares. Membership in LCAFs would now require joining with the whole land owned by the person, including the cattle and tools. In this way one couldn’t be a part of LCAF and produce privately as well.

*1948 - end of*: A law banning contracts on land rents.

*1949*: Temporary step back for the government. Takings were decreased, buy-off prices were increased. Commissions were set up to investigate overbearing in land collectivization up till then. However the numerous claims by peasants lead to hardening of the pressure again.

*1950 Apr*: Further limitations of personal posessions - from 2 to 5 decares of land (depending on the area), as well as one horse (or mule or donkey), one cow and up to 5 sheep.

*1950*: Approximately 50% of Bulgarian peasants were already members of LCAFs.

*1950 Jul*: Riots in Norhtwestern Bulgaria and near Plovdiv (mostly by women).

*1951 Mar*: A plenary session of CC of BCP condemning the perversions of the party policy in agriculture. However many peasans took it to mean that they could leave the LCAFs which lead to using force and clashes. Some 3 500 were resettled and some 3 500 were imprisoned. Despite that, mass collectivization was temporarily stopped.

*1956*: A plenary session of CC of BCP lead to a decision to finish land collectivization within maximum 3 years.

> *note*: The authorities tried the carrot, instead of the stick. First, the land for personal posession was exempted from the system of takings. Second, members of LCAFs would receive agricultural pension (starting from 1957). Third, the so called “kulaks” who had been persecuted before that would be allowed to become members of the cooperative (but without the right to occupy management positions). Fourth, inefficient LCAFs would receive state subsidies. As a result the collectivization of land was finished by the end of the 1950s.

*1950s - late*: Increased buy-off prices lead to increased agricultural production.

*1960*: Agricultural production exceeded its pre-war level by 41,7%.

### The Concentration of Agricultural Farms

*1970 Apr*: A decision was made to create “agrarian-industrial complexes” and “industrial-agrarian complexes”. Within a few month approximately 800 LCAFs were united in 161 agrarian-industrial complexes and industrial-agrarian complexes. The average complex had an area of 274 000 decares and 6 500 workers. This horizontal integration had to be followed by vertical integration (according to a decision in 1973) but this didn’t happen.

Industry and Finance in Socialist Bulgaria
------------------------------------------

> *note*: The costs of WWII (including military actions, destructions from bombings, reparations to Greece and Yugoslavia, investment foregone in newly captured lands, debt claims to Germany, delivery of supplies to the Soviet army) amounted to 372 billion levs (\~ 825 million dollars) with a national income for 1945 of 141 billion levs. In 1945 the national income was 50% of its 1943 level.
>
> After the end of the war direct taxes were increased 8 times.
>
> In 1947 all banknotes of 200–5000 levs were removed from circulation. In exchange owners were given in cash banknotes of smaller denominations of up to 2 000 levs. The others were put in bank deposits (up to 15 000 levs were untaxed, up to 200 000 levs - approximately 400 dollars - were taxed 25%, above 2 million levs were taxed by 70%). Money supply was decreased from 70 billion levs to 21 billion levs.
>
> In May 1947 a law transferred the property of all German and Hungarian enterprises in Bulgaria to the Soviet Union. The transfer included only the assets and not the obligations of the enterprises, which fell on the Bulgarian side. The assets amounted to \~ 1,5 billion levs.

*1947 Jul*: Bulgaria got a 20 million dollars credit from the USSR. The credit had to be repaid in 4 years at a 3% interest rate in kind (export of tobacco, ore and food products)

*1947 Dec*: Start of the nationalization of industry and banks. By 1949 it included 7 000 enterprises.

*1949*: The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance was established (Comecon).

*1949*: Within Comecon Bulgaria got several in-kind credits (machinery) from the USSR amounting to 60 million rubles (1 dollar = 5 rubles officially) which was to be repaid in kind by Bulgaria.

*1949–1953*: First five year plan. According to the plan (adopted at a congress of BCP in 1948) the ratio of the value created in agriculuture and industry had to be changed from 70:30 to 55:45. Heavy industry was to get 83% of all investments in industry.

> Many new powerplants were constructed - near Sofia, Pernik, Dimitrovgrad. The metalurgical plant in Pernik was constructed. The chemical plant in Dimitrovgrad was constructed.
>
> *note*: In this period the authorities relied a lot not on material incentives but on building a new socialist work ethos and immaterial rewards. It marked the rise of the so called “brigadir movement”. There were \~ 300 000 brigadirs in 1949–1950.

*1951 - by*: Trade with Western countries had a share of 6,9% (17,9% in 1949).

> *note*: Trade with USSR was unfavourable because the official course of the ruble (against the dollar) was overvalued, i.e. the Bulgarian goods could be sold at higher prices at international markets in Western countries.

*1952 - by*: According to official data industrial production was 4 times higher than the pre-war level.

*1952*: The share of industrial production was 47,1% of the total production.

> *note*: In the first five-year plan accent fell on heavy industry and the production of means of production instead of on consumer goods. Production however was very often for its own sake without considering its subsequent realization. The enterprises had accumulated excessive inventory of goods amounting to 1,2 billion new levs (\~ 28 billion old) which couldn’t be sold on either the internal or external markets.

*1953 May*: A strike of tobacco workers in Plovdiv against the new production norms (who were very high)

*1953*: After Stalin’s death the new authorities in Moscow decided to pay more attention to providing the people with basic goods for mass consumption, which lead to a decision to develop more the light industry and agriculture (to be abandoned in 1955). Bulgaria followed suite, but provision of agricultural goods to the Bulgarian population was not very successful due to bad weather and increased exports to USSR and other socialist countries.

*1956 Feb*: Bulgaria and USSR signed an agreement for providing help to the Bulgarian agriculture and industry. The Bulgarian government got a credit of 300 million rubles at 2% annual interest rate and a period of 10 years with which it could finance the import of agricultural machinery from the USSR.

*1956 May*: At a Comecon session Todor Zhivkov insisted that Bulgaria returned to the path of accelerated industrialization. According to the Soviet politicians, within Comecon Bulgaria had to specialize in agriculture and light industry.

> *note*: However after the Hungarian events Zhivkov managed to exploit Bulgaria’s political loyalty to USSR and to convince the Soviet authority to allow Bulgaria to develop heavy industry. Priority sectors would become machine-building, metal- and chemical industries.

*1958*: At the 8th Comecon session the member states agreed to allow Bulgaria to export machinery and other heavy industry products

*1950s - end*: Bulgaria had accumulated credits of 792 million rubles towards other socialist countries. This lead to debt levels of 176% of the annual exports for these countries. Bulgaria ran trade deficits which were covered with long-term credits. In order to cover its debts (without decreasing its imports), Bulgaria had to increase twice its export towards other socialist countries for a period of 5–6 years.

*1958*: Comecon accepted to use international prices in trade between its members which further increased the marge between the total value of import and export for Bulgaria (leading to further deficits)

*1960 Nov*: Bulgaria got a credit from the USSR for the metalurgical plant Kremikovtzi and the powerplant Maritsa-Iztok. The credit amounted to 600 million rubles. This was the biggest credit extended by the Soviet Union at the time. The payment of another 210 million rubles debt was postponed. The credit allowed Bulgaria to maintain growth without cutting consumption.

*1960–1964*: First debt crisis.

> *note*: According to official data in the third five-year plan Bulgaria achieved annual growth of the industrial production of 23% (twice higher than in the second five-year plan). The modernization of industry could be done better by imports of machinery and equipment from the west. Trade volumes with Western countries increased from 45 million dollars in 1954 to 200 million dollars in 1959. However growth of import exceeded the growth of export. Bulgaria exported agricultural goods and imported machinery, metals and final goods for mass consumption. The export of agricultural goods was limited by the obligations towards other socialist countries and by the lower level of investments in the sector. At the same time import of goods from Western countries increased due to unfulfilled obligations for import from Comecon partners which had to be compensated with import from the West.
>
> *note*: Between 1957 and 1963 the country’s foreign debt went from \~ 25 million dollars to more than 160 million dollars.
>
> *note*: The Bulgarian government decided to sell its gold reserves in order to cover its debt (instead to cut consumption). Between 1962 and 1964 Bulgaria sold 23,5 tons of gold and after that was left with only 2,1 tons. The government also managed to negotiate rescheduling for some of the debt and to be paid in convertible currency for some of the Bulgarian export to USSR.

*1962–1971*: The government launched an economic experiment allowing more than 30 enterprises to work on market principles. The results being positive they decided to introduce a form of limited market mechanisms in the economy as a whole. This had to happen in 1968 and included measures such as planning from below (the State planning commission would determine only the macroframe for the five-year plan), direct contracting between enterprises (for producton beyond the specified by the obligatory indicators), self-reliance (though without bankrupcy), wages fund as a residual, investment at owns expenses or bank credit, bank control over the credit, and using international prices as indicators in internal price formation. However this initiative was constrained and instead the government introduced a series of decrees to strengthen the administrative control over the economy. In 1971 the enterprises that were run experimentally on market principles were either closed or returned to the administrative mode of functioning.

*1968 Nov*: Decree number 50 of the government launched a process of concentration in the economy by introducing “state economic unions”. Thousands of enterprises were united initially in 120 state economic unions and by 1970 - in 64. Later in the 1970s they were further concentrated in 11 national economic complexes.

*1957–1970*: Industrial production increased almost 6 times. In the meantime metalurgy increased its production 13 times, machine-building - 11 times, chemical industry - 11 times. These, alongside energy, were considered to be the priority sectors in this period.

*1969*: At a plenary session of CC of BCP was taken a decision to use the tools of the scientific and technical revolution to develop the Bulgarian economy. This lead to the creation of a number of research centers. New key sectors were chosen in 1976 - electronics, robotics, chemistry and biology. Bulgaria received free licences and technologies from USSR in the period 1978–1979.

*1973–1978*: Second debt crisis.

> *note*: The economic crisis that started in 1973 affected demand of Bulgarian exports in Western Europe and lead to drop in revenues in convertible currency. In the meantime the Bulgarian production was inefficient and used 1,5 to 2 times more inputs per final unit of production than production in the West. Economic plans considered higher levels of both import and export (26% relative to the previous year) but the export was far bellow the planned. This time Bulgaria’s government resorted to some unwanted measures such as decrease of investment and expenses, as well as decrease in imports. These measures would give result in the long-term, however short-term payments were due. Bulgaria again turned to USSR for help but surprisingly the Soviet representative criticized Bulgaria for being unwise in its economic policy - planning for unrealistically high growth, investing too much in metalurgy and not utilizing completely available resources. The Soviet side agreed to help only after a personal meeting between Zhivkov and Brezhnev. The help would be in a new investment credit, increased oil deliveries and postponment of existing debts. In 1979 an agreement was reached which gave Bulgaria 400 million rubles for the next two years as price additions to Bulgarian export to USSR. As a result the external debt was almost completely eliminated in the beginning of the 1980s.

1979 Mar: “The new economic mechanism”

> *note*: The party tried to introduce some pro-market measures such as:
>
> -   decentralization of planning
> -   decrease of the obligatory indicators
> -   create incentives for workers
> -   increase the role of contracts and prices
> -   make wages a residual
>
> This was the result of a signal from Moscow that it would allow such changes. However these changes were never implemented into practice.

*1984 Jan*: At a plenary session of Politbureau Zhivkov said that the effectiveness of economic reforms was constrained by the political system and that it blocked all attempts to implement the new economic approach.

*1987*: Gorbachev criticized Zhivkov for his view that changes without the party were unthinkable (later Zhivkov would abandoned this position) and that he had developed too close ties with the West (more specifically West Germany and Japan).

*1987 Jul*: At a plenary session of CC of BCP was taken a decision to allow people to manage (but not own) the enterprises in which they worked. This initiative however didn’t give the desired results and the authorities decided to go further by giving the people also ownership.

*1989 Jan*: Decree 56. It gave the right to private property, but it was limited. Stock companies could be established only by legal persons. In electronics, chemical industry, biotechnological industry, machine-building, insurance and construction the state would always have 51% of the shares. Only in services, trade and agriculture it would have less (but not less than 20%). Only the workers of the enterprise could receieve shares from it (but not more than 1% of the capital of the company and not more than 10 000 levs).

*1985–1989*: The third debt crisis. In 1979–1984 Bulgaria decreased its debt with 500 million dollars on average each year. Then it started to increas by 1,5 billion each year.

> *note*: Two developments lead to the third debt crisis of socialist Bulgaria. The first was the depreciated dollar. Since Bulgaria’s export was mostly denominated in dollars and Bulgaria’s import was denominated mostly in deutche marks this lead to less revenues from export and more payments for imports and an increased deficit in the trade balance. The other development was the drop in the price of the petrol. In the end of the 1970s the stabilization of export revenues had been the result also to the reexport of Soviet oil. This source of income of convertible currency was no longer available in its previous levels. The cheap oil also lead to bankruptcies of some oil exporting states which had accumulated debts toward Bulgaria (mostly payments owed for arms trade), such as Iraq, Iran, Libya, Nigeria, etc. This lead to Bulgaria failing to collect a debt of 2,8 billion dollars. Bulgaria again turned to USSR for help, but this time it faced a rejection.

Bulgaria as a Democratic Republic
=================================

The Transition to Democracy
---------------------------

### The Coup against Todor Zhivkov - 10 November 1989

*note:*

> Even before the coup against him, Todor Zhivkov had expressed his intention to step down. This happened in informal conversations to other party officials in 1987. On 22 November 1988 he submitted his resignation, but it was not accepted.
>
> The Soviets wanted to see Zhivkov out. There was a personal dislike by Gorbachev, but there was also the dissatisfaction with the Restoration process and the Big excursion.

*1988 Mar:* The new Soviet ambassador became the former KGB general Viktor Sharapov. He replaced the ambassador Grekov who was Zhivkov’s close friend.

*1989 Jul 7th:* At a meeting of the representatives of the Warsaw pact member states in Bucharest Petar Mladenov talked to Mikhail Gorbachev about a possible removal of Zhivkov. Gorbachev said that he was sympathetic, but that it was internal affair of the Bulgarians.

*1989 Jul-Aug:* Petar Mladenov met with the prime-minister Georgi Atanasov, discussing a possible removal of Zhivkov. After the removal Mladenov was supposed to take care of political developments and changes, Georgi Atanasov - of economic changes.

*1989 Sep:* Andrej Lukanov, Petar Mladenov, Viktor Sharapov and Valentin Terehov decided to take active steps to remove Zhivkov from power.

*1989 Oct 24:* Petar Mladenov submitted his resignation and wrote a letter putting Zhivkov in unfavourable light. In a telephone conversation the same day Zhivkov tried to convince Mladenov to retract his pull back his resigation. At a meeting of Politbureu two days later was discussed how to accept Mladenov’s resignation without making much noise about it. At the beginning of November Mladenov retracted his resignation, but not his letter.

*1989 Nov 3rd:* First anti-governmental demonstration in Sofia for the previous 40 years. The protesters submitted to the National Assembley a list of signature regarding ecological issues. The demonstration was suppressed and its organizers were arrested.

*1989 Nov 3rd:* Viktor Sharapov met with Todor Zhivkov, informing him of the removal of the GDR party leader Erich Honecker, hinting that probably Zhivkov was the next to go. They had several other meetings until 9th Nov. Zhivkov told Sharapov that probably it would be best if he resigned. After the affirmative response by the ambassador, Zhivkov said that the problem with this decision was that he saw no one worthy to take over. However as the least problematic figure he saw Aleksandar Lilov.

*1989 Nov 4th:* At a session of Politbureau Zhivkov said that Petar Mladenov in a state of affect had placed his resignation and refused to accept it.

*1989 Nov 7th:* At an event in the Soviet embassy Dobri Dzhurov, Dimitar Stanishev and Yordan Yotov said to Zhivkov that it would be better if he resigned at the upcoming plenary session of the Central Committe of the Bulgarian Communist Party on 10th November. Zhivkov responded that he had once already submitted his resignation in 1988, but “the comrades wouldn’t hear about it”. He concluded that he would thing about it and that he might, after all, resign at another plenary session.

*1989 Nov 9th:* At a meeting with some of his closest friends Zhivkov said that he considered Aleksandar Lilov alone as his own heir. Later on the same day he met with prime-minister Georgi Atanasov, who advised him to step down. Zhivkov responded that he would, but that he wanted Lilov as his successor. Later he also met with Yordan Yotov, Dobri Dzhurov and Dimitar Stanishev. They pressured him to resign. At a meeting of Politbureau held in the late afternoon he expressed his decision to resign. Milko Balev and Dimitar Stoyanov were against, but the other members were supportive of the intention.

*1989 Nov 10th:* Plenary session of the CK of BCP. Zhivkov expected to hear his resignation as a General Secretary of BCP read by Georgi Atanasov. In the lunch break he learned that his opposition intended to remove him not only as a General Secretary, but also as the Head of the State Council. At the end of the plenary session the new General Secretary was Petar Mladenov.

### First Steps into Democracy

*1989 Nov 17th:* Petar Mladenov was elected as Head of the State Council.

*1989 Nov 18th:* A big anticommunist demonstration in Sofia

*1989 Dec 7th:* The United Democratic Forces (UDF) was created as a union of dissident organizations and some restored political parties. The leader of the Union became Zhelyu Zhelev.

*1989 Dec 10th:* A big demonstration, organized by UDF in Sofia.

*1989 Dec 14th:* A big demonstration in Sofia. Protesters want a new constitution, taking away the special position of the Communist party in the government of the country. Protesters besieged the parliament. Tension went down after an official declaration that Article 1 of the Constituion would be removed. Allegedly, on that evening Petar Mladenov said that it would be better if the tanks came.

*1989 Dec 29th:* Plenary session of the Central Committe of the Bulgarian Communist Party. The party renounced the Restoration process.

*1990 Jan 3rd:* Start of the Round table. It lasted until 15th May 1990. It included sessions of negotiations between the Communist party and the opposition, represented by the UDF. The parties at the table agreed on strategic documents to form the basis of the development of Bulgaria post-communism. A decision was made to hold elections for a Great National Assembley in June.

*note:*

> UDF had tried and succeeded to keep away from the Round table third parties, such as trade unions, fearing that they might be puppets to the Communist party. Also, as a condition to start negotiations it demanded its own building (they got the building at 134 Rakovski St in Sofia), its own newspaper and access to national media.

*1990 Jan 4th:* Leaders of the Turkish minority established the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF). Its leader became Ahmed Dogan.

*1990 Jan 20th:* Todor Zhivkov was arrested.

*note:*

> Following his loss of power Todor Zhivkov was put to trial on charges of property and financial crimes, and for the Restoration process. Thus, he shared the fate of many other Bulgarian prime-ministers. There were 29 prime-ministers in the Third Bulgarian Kingdom. Of those only 18 were\_ either brought to trial, arrested, jailed, killed or forced to emigrate and 6 were killed (2 while active prime-ministers). There were 9 prime-ministers of the People’s Republic of Bulgaria. Of these two were brought to trial (Todor Zhivkov and Georgi Atanasov) and one was killed (Andrej Lukanov). Initially found gilty and sentenced to 7 years prison time, Zhivkov was found innocent by the Supreme Court on 9 Feb 1996.

*1990 Feb 8th:* Andrej Lukanov became the new prime minister.

*1990 Mar 29th:* Andrej Lukanov declared moratorium on Bulgaria’s external debt. His motives were that the Bulgarian economy couldn’t service its debt while transitioning from a command-and-control to market economy. The credit rating of Bulgaria plummeted.

*1990 Jun 10th:* Elections for the 7th Great National Assembley. The Socialist party (the former communists) won the majority of seats getting 211 out of 400 seats with a very high voter turnout of 79%. UDF came second with 144 seats, MRF came third with 23 seats, the Agrarian Union got 16 seats and some minor parties and independents got the rest. The assembley functioned from 10 July 1990 till 2 October 1991. Its main goal was to adopt a new constitution.

*1990 Jul 6th:* Petar Mladenov resigned as a president following accusations and footages of him saying that it would be better if the tanks came.

*1990 Aug 1st:* Zhelyu Zhelev was elected by Parliament as the new president.

*1990 Aug:* Campaign to remove communist symbols from public buildings. Two protesters threatened to set themselves on fire if the communist star was not removed from the top of the then Home of the party (now the main government building). Tension rose and the building was set on fire. The socialist party said that it allowed this to happen in order to avoid escalation of violence. The democrats said that it was a provocation by the socialists who hoped to escalate the tension in this way.

*1990 November:* A vote of no-confidence against the government of Lukanov initiated by UDF. The government survived.

*1990 Nov 29th:* Andrej Lukanov resigned as a prime-minister, following national strikes, organized by the trade unions. A new cabinet was formed, also headed by Lukanov, but it lasted less than a month.

*note:*

> Lukanov’s government was unsuccessful in mitigating the economic consequences of the transition. The stores and shops were empty, coupon system was introduced for some goods and there was electricity regime. These became known as Lukanov’s winter.

*1990 Dec 7th:* The cabinet of Dimitar Popov was formed. It lasted until November 1991.

*1991 Mar:* Law on ownership and use of agricultural land. It restored private property on agricultural land, which had been previously nationalized.

*note:*

> In 1992 only 6,2% was restored in its original borders to either its previous owners or their heirs. It was not until the end of 2000 when 98% of the land was restored. The process left Bulgaria with some 2 000 000 land owners and land property of the median owner of 2–5 to 20 dekars. In 1989 the agricultural production in Bulgaria amounted to 2,38 billion USD. It wasn’t reached until 2004 when the value of agricultural production amounted to 2,27 billion USD, and in 2007 it reached 3,24 billion USD. In 1990–2008 (with exception of 2007) trade balance with agricultural goods was positive.

*1991 Jul 12th:* New Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria. It specified that Bulgaria was a multi-party democracy with separation of the legal, legislative and executive powers and with private property and individual rights for its citizens.

*1991 Nov 4th:* New parliament. Out of the 240 seats UDF got 110, BSP got 106 and MRF got 24. UDF made a cabinet chaired by Filip Dimitrov, even though they didn’t have absolute majority in the parliament.

*1992 Jan:* Zhelyu Zhelev won the first direct elections for president. In this way UDF took control over all key political positions.

*1992 Feb:* Law on the restitution of nationalized real estate. It affected mostly urban property.

*1992:* The government of Filip Dimitrov managed to get a 3-year gratis period for payments on the Bulgarian debt.

*1992 May 14th:* Bulgaria started negotiations to become associated member of the EU.

*1992 Jul 9th:* Andrej Lukanov’s immunity as a member of the parliament was removed and he was arrested on charges of property crimes perpetrated in 1986–1989. The court proclaimed him non-guilty and he was released on 30 December 1992.

*1992 Autumn:* A law on privatisation of state and municipality owned enterprises. However large-scale privatisation started after 1997 with the government of Ivan Kostov.

*note:*

> Industrial production level fell after the end of socialism. The indices of physical output didn’t reach it’s 1989 level until 2006. In 1990 alone there was a drop of 20%. The lowest level was reached in 1999 (60% of the 1989 level). During the 1990s the annual investment in long-term material assets was approximately 1/10 of its 1990 level. It was not until 2008 that the 1990 level (6 billion USD) was reached. The structure of industrial production also changed. In 1990 the top three industrial sectors were machine building and electronics (27,1% of total industrial production), food industry (27,1%), chemical industry (12%). In 2010 the top three industrial sectors were food industry (17,1%), mining and metallurgy (16,3%), electricity (15,3%).
>
> State revenues declined from 43% of GDP in 1991 to 35% (they stabilized to 35–38% in the 2000s) . This was mostly the result of a drop in revenues from the profit tax, which were 17% of GDP in 1991 and 5% in 1993. Profit tax amounted to 2–3% of GDP in the 2000s. The most important tax became VAT, which provided revenues amounting to \~10% of GDP. Bulgaria moved from high and progressive taxation in the beginning of the period (30–50% standard tax rate on profit and 20–52% marginal tax rate on income) to flat tax of 10% in 2007 and 2008. The government managed to decrease its gross debt from 97% of GDP in 1997 to 16% in 2010. However gross external debt (private and public) rose from less than 10 billion USD in 1999 to 37 billion USD (90% of GDP) in 2013.

*1992 Oct 28th:* The government of UDF was brought down after a successful vote of no-confidende. Filip Dimitrov resigned as a prime-minister.

*1992 Dec 30th:* A new cabinet was formed with prime-minister Lyuben Berov. Berov was not openly affiliated to any party. Though he had been an economic adviser to president Zhelev, he was often supported by BSP and MRF. Most people considered that his government was controlled by Ahmed Dogan, leader of MRF, the 3rd party in parliament.

*note:*

> UDF made six unsuccessful attempts to bring down the Berov cabinet in parliament. It was a period of political turmoil and economic instability, marked by the rise in organized crime. The situation was additionally worsened by the international sanctions towards Iraq and Lybia (who had significant debt towards Bulgaria accumulated before 1989) and later because of the embargo against Yugoslavia. In 1994 the unemployment rate exceeded 20%.

*1993 Mar 9th:* Bulgaria finished the negotiation process to become an associated member of the European Union. It formally became an associated member on 1 February 1995 after the ratification process was finished.

*1994 Feb:* Bulgaria joined the “Partnership for peace initiative” which marked the official beginning of the country’s way to NATO membership.

*1994 Sep 2nd:* Berov resigned as a prime minister recognizing failures in its economic policies. The president Zhelyu Zhelev disbanded the 36th National Assembley and scheduled new elections for December.

*1994 Oct 17th:* A new transitional cabinet was formed, chaired by Reneta Indzhova (officially not affiliated with any party). Its main goal was to organize the forthcoming elections

*1995 Jan 12th:* Following the elections the 37th National Assembley started work. BSP had 125 seats out of 240.

### The Videnov Crisis

*1995 Jan 25th:* BSP formed a new cabinet, chaired by Zhan Videnov.

*1995 Feb 1st:* Bulgaria became associated member of the European union.

*note:*

> Bulgaria and the EU had to create a free-trade zone in 10 years. Bulgaria’s exports of industrial goods to the EU had to become free from tariffs until the end of 1998. Imports of industrial goods from the EU could be charged with 0–30% of the base import tariff, depending on its category. Trade with agricultural production was conducted within mutual preferential quotas, that would increase by 5% per year for Bulgarian exports. Trade volume increased almost twice for 1992–1999.

*1995 Dec 14th:* The 37th National Assembly approved a decision that Bulgaria would apply for EU membership.

*1996 Oct 2:* Andrej Lukanov was killed in front of his home. Several men were charged with his murder, but none got a guilty verdict.

*1996 autumn:* Petar Stoyanov, representative of the UDF forces, won the elections for president.

*note:*

> The Videnov cabinet slowed down the reforms, if not outright reversing them. In 1995 the debts of many state-owned enterprises were abolished and many of them got state subsidies. Pensions and social transfers were increased. This run against the recommendations of the IMF which lead to breaking of relations with the organisation. Additional strain on the Bulgarian economy came from the expiry of the 3-year gratis period on the payments of the external debt. Bulgaria had to pay 2 billion USD to service it.
>
> Inflation had been high even before the Videnov crisis. For the period 1991–1994 the best achievement was 64% end-of-period inflation for 1993. In March 1994 alone the BGL depreciated by almost 100% at the foreign exchange market. This depreciation was absorbed by the domestic inflation which exceeded 120% by the end of the year. In 1995 however inflation was put under control reaching “only” 33%. BNB lowered the base interest rate from 72% to 34%, while real interest rates on deposits and credits remained positive. Interest rate differentials between lev and foreign currency instruments attracted foreign investment, which lead to bulid up of foreign exchange reserves, which increased from 1,31 billion USD to 1,54 billion USD by the end of the year.
>
> Many large state-owned enterprises incurred losses which were financed either by banks or by a growing budget deficit. In the early years many new banks appeared but control and regulation by BNB was low. At the end of 1994 about 40 banks were operating: 10 large state-owned banks (with a share of 80% of the total banking sector), over 20 newly set private banks (mainly small and medium), about half a dozen foreign banks and branches of foreign banks with a total share of less than 5%. Private banks were usually created with credit from state banks. They in turn extended a lot of bad credit. It amounted to 40% of the 1995 GDP. Often bank officials had relations or were part of the management of the companies with the loans.
>
> BNB also had very low foreing exchange reserves which didn’t allow to support the Bulgarian lev from depreciation at the foreign exchange markets.
>
> Due to banks having many bad loans to unperforming state-owned enterprises, this led to decapitalization of a number of banks. This was quickly realized by the population and in the late 1995 the first deposit runs on sume banks turned them illiquid. This lead to BNB refinancing them as a lender of last resort to support the payments system. This only postponed the problem.
>
> In the first months of 1996 there was a run on the whole banking system. BNB foreign exchange reserves fell to 800 million USD by the end of the year. In the second quarter of the year the sale of foreign exchange stopped while support for banks continued and even intensified. The Bulgarian lev depreciated by 600% for the whole 1996 and the anual inflation reached 310%. The base interest rate was raised from 34% to 108% per year, and then to 25% per month (in September).
>
> Savings deposits’ real drop was almost 70%. The government budget run a 11% deficit. About 1/3 of the total number of banks were found insolvent and were closed by BNB. GDP contracted by 11% in 1996 and unemployment increased to 12,5%. In late December the government resigned and the National Assembly decided for the BNB to extend a direct credit to the government totaling over 6% of GDP to meet its finanscial needs at the end of the fiscal year. The bank extended the credit and practically removed the last barrier to a sharp depreciation of the lev and the following hyperinflation in early 1997.

*1996 Dec 21nd:* Zhan Videnov resigned at a congress of BSP from his role as party leader and also anounced his resignation from the government.

*1996 Dec 28th:* The resignation of the Videnov cabinet was accepted by the 37th National Assembly. BSP tried to form a new cabinet but it faced strong support from the opposition and the population under the form of street protests.

*1997 Jan 10th:* Angry protesters raided the building of the National Assembly. This act was followed by daily protests in all over the country.

*1997 Jan:* Petar Stoyanov stepped into his position as a president

*1997 Feb 4th:* Put under pressure BSP announced that they gave up power in the parliament and that there will be new elections.

### Stabilization and pro-Western orientation.

*1997 Feb 12th:* President Petar Stoyanov appointed Stefan Sofyanski as the head of the new interim government.

*1997 Mar 17th:* The new government adopted a national programme for Bulgaria’s membership in NATO.

*1997 Apr 19th:* New elections for parliament. UDF won convincingly, getting 137 seats (out of 240). BSP came second with 58 seats.

*1997 May 21st:* Ivan Kostov became the new prime-minister, heading the cabinet formed by UDF.

*note:*

> Ivan Kostov was the first prime-minister after the democratic changes who managed to go through the full 4-year-term. He had been part of the goverment before as a finance minister in the cabinets of Dimitar Popov and Filip Dimitrov.
>
> Important decision in the economic policy of the new government was the introduction of the currency board on 1 July 1997. According to the currency board arrangement the Bulgarian lev was pegged to the German mark at a rate of 1 000 levs for 1 DM, subsequently 1 955,3 levs for 1 EUR and after the money reform - 1,9553 levs for 1 EUR. This pegged exchange rate was secured by sufficient foreign exchange reserve, which covered all the money in curculation in Bulgarian levs. The board took away the possibility of BNB to carry out open market operations and to set the base interest rate. It was left only with the possibility to determine the minimum reserve requirements of commercial banks.
>
> Another important economic policy, undertaken by the government of Kostov was to speed up privatisation. Privatisation was launched in 1992. For the period 1993–2012 were privatised 66% of the assets of state enterprises. Only during the cabinet of Kostov (1997–2001) were privatised 45% of the assets. Total revenue from privatisation for the period was approximately 10 billion USD. Around a third of the revenues was generated in the privatisation deals during Kostov’s term.
>
> Kostov’s government stated explicitly Bulgaria’s pro-Western orientation. On 4 May 1999 it gave air corridor to NATO for intervention in the conflict in Yugoslovia for the resolution of the Kosovo crisis.

*1999 Jul 3rd:* The Law on prices was abolished. From then on all prices were freely set on the market with the exception of electricyt, coal, central heating, phone and postal services and cigarettes. On the same day the Law for consumer protection came into force.

*1999 Nov 29th:* Bulgaria signed a memorandum with EU to stop using the old blocks of the nuclear power station “Kozloduy”.

*1999 Dec 10th:* The European Council in Helsinki took the decision to start negotiations for accession with 6 countries, among them Bulgaria.

*2000 Feb 15th:* Negotiations between Bulgaria and EU were officially launched at an intergovernmental conference.

*2000 Dec 1st:* The Council of Ministers of EU took the decision to take Bulgaria out of the negative Schengen list.

*note:*

> Despite the fact that the Kostov managed to stay as a prime-minister for a full term, there were many corruption scandals with ministers from the cabinet, which had a negative effect on his party.

*2001 Apr:* Bulgaria was formally excluded from the negative Schengen list.

*2001 Apr:* The former Bulgarian king Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha announced that he would enter Bulgarian politics.

### Years of Prosperity and Accession to NATO and EU

*2001 June:* The parliamentary elections were won by the political movement of Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. His formation “Simeon II” got 120 seats out of 240. UDF got 51 seats, BSP - 48 and MRF - 21.

*2001 July 21st:* A coalition government was formed by “Simeon II” and MRF. The new prime-minister became Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.

*2001 Nov:* Surprisingly, the then president Petar Stoyanov lost the presidential elections to the leader of the socialists Georgi Parvanov. Thus Bulgaria became a unique country in the European history, ruled at the same time by former monarch and a former communist.

*2001 Nov 21st:* At a NATO meeting in Prague a decision was taken to invite Bulgaria to start talks for NATO membership.

*2002 Dec:* At the Coppenhagen Summit Bulgaria and Romania got a roadmap for their accession to the EU.

*2003 Mar 26th:* At a NATO meeting in Brussels the permanent representatives of the NATO member-states signed the protocols for the accession of 6 countries, among which was Bulgaria.

*2003 Oct 19th:* By that time Bulgaria had closed all the “technical” chapters from the negotiation process - 26 out of 30.

*2003 Dec:* At a summit of the European Council in Brussels was decided that Bulgaria would become a member of the EU on 1 January 2007.

*2004 Mar 18:* The Bulgarian Parliament ratified the treaty with NATO. The official celebrations for Bulgaria’s accession to NATO were held on 2 April 2004.

*2005 Apr 13th:* The European Parliament confirmed the treaty for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania.

*2005 Apr 25th:* At a special ceremony in Luxembourg was signed the treaty for Bulgaria’s accession to the European Union.
